**Project Insight**
Atliq  has recorded a revenue of 1.7bn in 3 months from all hotels. The luxury categories make the bigger portion (61.62%) of the revenue
- Highest Revenue was recorded from hotels in Mumbai with a Revenue of 661M
- Despite Mumbai recording the highest the, month with the highest is May followed by a decline in June and July
- Lowest Revenue was recorded from hotels in Delhi
- Similarly to Mumbai, Delhi recorded the highest Revenue in May and there's been a steady decline through the rest of month
- Alttiq Graands property in Bangalore  and Delhi Generates the lowest revenue among the property owned by Altiq in those cities
- The fluctuation of RevPar and %Occupancy follows the same trend with ADR being constant through the 3month
- High realization% correlates low cancellation%
- Most Hotels with high realization% have a higher rating
- Hotels with low occupancy% have a low rating
- Weekday weekend ADR are constant

**Final Conclusion:**
ADR being constant is an indication of fixed pricing and other pricing methods could be employed to maximize revenue on occupancy
Rating review should be analyzed to determine what the customers are saying about the hotels with lower rating.

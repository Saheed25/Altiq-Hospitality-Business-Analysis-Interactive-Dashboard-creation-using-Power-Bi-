- Highest Revenue was recorded from hotels in Mumbai with a Revenue of 661M
- Despite Mumbai recording the highest the, month with the highest is May followed by a decline in June and July
- Lowest Revenue was recorded from hotels in Delhi
- Similarly to Mumbai, Delhi recorded the highest Revenue in May and there's been a steady decline through the rest of month
- Alttiq Graands property in Bangalore  and Delhi Generates the lowest revenue among the property owned by Altiq in those cities
- The fluctuation of RevPar and %Occupancy follows the same trend with ADR being constant through the 3month
- High realization% correlates low cancellation%
- Most Hotels with high realization% have a higher rating
- Hotels with low occupancy% have a low rating
- Weekday weekend ADR are constant

**Final Conclusion:**
- ADR being constant is an indication of fixed pricing and other pricing methods could be employed to maximize revenue on occupancy
- Rating review should be analyzed to determine what the customers are saying about the hotels with lower rating.
